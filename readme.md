## Full Ride Code Challenge

### Yahtzee Challenge

**Object**: Roll dice for scoring combinations, and get the highest total score.

**Game Summary**: On each turn, roll the dice up to 3 times to get the highest 
scoring combination for one of the categories on the scorecard.  After you
finish rolling, you must place a score or a zero in one of the category boxes on
the score card.  The game ends when all players have filled the categories.
Scores are totaled and the player with the highest total wins.

**Taking a turn**: On your turn, you may roll the dice up to 3 times, although
you may stop and score after your first or second roll.

Example:
_First Roll_: You roll all 5 dice and you decide to keep 3 of the rolls.
_Second Roll_: You roll the other 2 dice and get 1 that you want to keep.
_Third Roll_: You don't roll what you want so you keep the 4 and fill in a
category on your scorecard.
